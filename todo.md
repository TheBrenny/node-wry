Here are some things because I will definitely forget:

- [ ] Make sure all the options for building a webview are implemented and working
- [ ] Be able to hook into the event loop and run a callback when a message is received
  - [ ] This means we need to expose all the "Event" types so users can match on them
  - [ ] Also expose a way to create an event proxy for the user to send messages to the webview
