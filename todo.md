Here are some things because I will definitely forget:

- [x] Make sure all the options for building a webview are implemented and working
- [ ] Implement the "Handler" options:
  - [ ] .with_custom_protocol()
  - [ ] .with_download_completed_handler()
  - [ ] .with_download_started_handler()
  - [ ] .with_file_drop_handler()
  - [ ] .with_ipc_handler()
  - [ ] .with_navigation_handler()
  - [ ] .with_new_window_req_handler()
  - [ ] .with_web_context()
- [x] Be able to hook into the event loop and run a callback when a message is received
  - [x] This means we need to expose all the "Event" types so users can match on them
    - [x] NewEvents
    - [x] WindowEvent
    - [x] DeviceEvent
    - [x] UserEvent
    - [x] MenuEvent
    - [x] TrayEvent
    - [x] GlobalShortcutEvent
    - [x] Suspended
    - [x] Resumed
    - [x] MainEventsCleared
    - [x] RedrawRequested
    - [x] RedrawEventsCleared
    - [x] LoopDestroyed
  - [ ] Also expose a way to create an event proxy for the user to send UserEvents
- [ ] Fix the CI to auto-publish using GitHub
